<p>As mentioned previously, BrowzOS is an open-source project; this 
means all the HTML pages and applets contained in this package can be 
downloaded and modified to the designer's content (so long as all credits and 
ownership of copyrights are acknowledged and retained as per the GNU Affero GPL).</p>
<p>There are only 2 simple steps for the average computer user:</p>
<ol><li>Download the source package (available in many different archive file formats)</li>
  <li>Extract the package to any folder on the hard drive and make any necessary changes to the 
  scripts, web pages and applets in the package (this would also include adding 
  and removing various applets and scripts as needed)</li></ol>
<p>There are 3 steps for web designers to get started:</p>
<ol><li>Download the source package (available in many different archive file formats)</li>
  <li>Extract the package and make any necessary changes to the 
  scripts, web pages and applets in the package (this would also include adding 
  &amp; removing various applets and scripts as needed)</li>
  <li>Upload the files to any directory on the server in use</li></ol>
<p>Once the package has been downloaded and extracted, edit the web pages as needed. This includes adding/removing scripts and applets as needed, editing scripts as needed, changing the file names of the HTML pages as needed and editing the contents of the HTML pages as needed (i.e.: adding/removing links, icons, etc.) If BrowzOS is to be uploaded to a web server, do so once all the desired changes have been completed.</p>
