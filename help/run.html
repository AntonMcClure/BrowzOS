<p>Installing &quot;applications&quot; into BrowzOS is quite easy if the 
package has been extracted to a client computer's hard drive; it is simply a 
matter of editing the package's web pages and scripts by adding/removing icons 
and applets. The contents of the BrowzOS package is extremely modular, since each important applet 
and script has its own directory and index file. So, installing an &quot;application&quot; 
isn't too complicated, considering that a fair amount of HTML programming is required. In simple terms, 
installing &quot;applications&quot; requires the creation of a folder in the main directory (to store 
the needed applet, index and all other needed files,) as well as the editing of the Dock and Desktop scripts 
in the main package.</p>
<p>Sadly, installing &quot;programs&quot; in BrowzOS while accessing it from a web 
browser has not been implemented and is, therefore, impossible at the moment (not 
to say that it's outright impossible, though). Theoretically, a web designer can have all 
the needed applets installed on a server as (otherwise hidden) available 
&quot;installation&quot; packages, then run a script which can customise the Desktop and 
Dock's icons to unhide the hidden applets, thus &quot;installing a program&quot; into 
BrowzOS through a web browser.</p>
<p>Running each &quot;program&quot; from BrowzOS (regardless of the package being installed on a client or server computer) is as simple as opening and using any other program on any mainstream operating system. As stated previously, an &quot;application&quot; can be executed by clicking on the Desktop icon's name or on the Dock icon's image with the mouse cursor. The &quot;program&quot; will then open in its own pop-up window. Closing the &quot;program&quot; is a matter of closing aid window.</p>
<p>The fact that these &quot;applications&quot; are so similar to the 
programs available on any mainstream operating system means using each individual 
&quot;application&quot; does not require users to have special training. However, as each 
&quot;program&quot; is different and unique, instructions and tutorials for each 
individual applet have been included inside their respective folders in the 
BrowzOS package (this is especially critical for web designers). Please refer to 
the included tutorials and instructions before use and modification (they're either found in text files 
or in the form of comments within the index file's HTML code). If instructions for any particular 
applet cannot be found, please consult the <a href="credits.html">Credits</a> page of this manual for a 
list of applet/script creators and their sites. If said sites are unreachable, please consult this website's forum.</p>
