<p>As mentioned previously, these are the basic requirements for web designers who wish to run BrowzOS 
from a server:</p>
<ul><li>Any client computer with internet access and any client-side operating 
system (i.e.: GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
<li>Any file archiving program or file compression program with ZIP 
file read/write access</li>
<li>Any SSH and/or FTP client program to access a server across the 
internet</li>
<li>Any text editor, rich text editor or &quot;what-you-see-is-what 
you-get&quot; editor (such as Frontpage, SciTe, Notepad, Vi, Microsoft Word, etc.)</li>
<li>Any server computer running server software (like Apache, IIS or 
similar)&nbsp; and any mainstream server operating system (i.e.: FreeBSD, 
Windows Server 2003, etc.)</li>
<li>Any mainstream web browser with the ability to run web applets 
and scripts (i.e.: Internet Explorer 6 and over, Mozilla 1.7 and over, Mozilla 
Firefox, Safari, Netscape 6 and over, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: ActiveX controls and/or web browser 
plug-ins) for both client computers and servers which enable mainstream web browsers to properly run certain web 
applets and scripts (examples are Java, Flash, Shockwave, JavaScript, Visual 
BASIC script, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: programming language run-time files) 
which enable both mainstream server and client operating systems to properly run 
certain web applets and scripts (like ASP, .NET framework, PHP, SQL, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there are 3 steps for web designers to get started with 
BrowzOS:</p>
<ol><li>Download the package (it is 
  available in multiple file formats, including ZIP, 7zip, RAR, etc.)</li>
  <li>Extract the package and make any necessary changes to the 
  scripts, web pages and applets in the package (this would also include adding 
  &amp; removing various applets and scripts as needed)</li>
  <li>Upload the files to any directory on the server in use</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit the web pages as needed. This includes adding/removing 
scripts and applets as needed, editing scripts as needed, changing the file 
names of the HTML pages as needed and editing the contents of the HTML pages 
as needed (i.e.: adding/removing links, icons, etc.)
<p>If an applet or script requires directory/file access on a web server, log into the 
server (using either an FTP or SSH client) and change the file attributes of the 
directory to allow full read/write/execute permissions to the Owner, Group and 
Public user groups. In an FTP client, this is done by right-clicking on the folder, 
selecting File Attributes and either selecting all the check boxes or changing 
the numeric value to &quot;0777&quot; or &quot;777.&quot; In an SSH client, log into the UNIX shell 
and type either of the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>chmod a+rwx foldername</li>
  <li>chmod 0777 foldername</li>
  <li>chmod 777 foldername</li>
</ul>
<p>Where &quot;foldername&quot; is the name of the folder whose  attributes need to be changed. This can 
also be done to individual files that require full access and modification such as text files and database files; 
simply substitute &quot;foldername&quot; with the name of the file whose attributes need to be changed.</p>
<p>If the extracted/edited package is uploaded into a website's 
folder on a server (i.e.: if the package has been uploaded to
<a href="ftp://www.yourdomain.com/yourdomain.com/">
ftp://www.yourdomain.com/yourdomain.com/</a> or 
<a href="ftp://yoursubdomain.domain.com/yoursubdomain.domain.com/">
ftp://yoursubdomain.domain.com/yoursubdomain.domain.com/</a>,)  open the 
web browser, type the web address and the index page is loaded (which can be 
changed as needed). If the extracted/edited package is uploaded into a folder 
residing inside an actual domain or sub-domain's main website folder, changes 
are need to the already-existing index page in order to allow navigation to the BrowzOS 
index page (again, anyone can change the BrowzOS index page as needed).</p>
<p>When designing applets that require direct file access on a 
client computer from a server, the best programming language to use for creating 
the applet is Java. Typical Java applets do not have file access on a client 
computer for security reasons. However, Java applets may be signed with a 
certificate, which will give them the ability to access the client computer's 
hard drive. Usually, web designers who work for professional organisations and 
corporations can apply for a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA,) 
which can cost $150-$400 per year. For other web designers (especially hobbyists 
and open-source web designers) who do not have the money to spend for a 
certificate from a CA, Java applets can be self-signed (at no monetary cost) 
with a home-made test certificate.</p>
<p>Even though home-made test certificates are free when compared to CA 
certificates, the only true difference between them is the 
fact that, when self-signed, the web browser will not recognise the applet as 
having been created by a trustworthy source; it will be identified as 
trustworthy only when signed using a CA certificate. Because of this, a client 
computer user must grant permission for the applet to run and install the test 
certificate. In any case, whether or not it is signed using a CA or 
test certificate, the Java applet will still retain the unrestricted 
functionality of direct file access on a client computer's hard drive.</p>
<p>When using Sun's Java SDK, the simplest way to self-sign a Java 
applet is by completing the following commands in a command prompt:</p>
<ol><li>keytool -genkey -dname &quot;cn=Creator&quot; -validity 365 -storepass StorePassword -keypass KeyPassword</li>
<li>keytool -selfcert</li>
<li>jarsigner java_applet.jar -keystore StorePassword -keypass KeyPassword mykey</li></ol>
<p>Where &quot;StorePassword&quot; and &quot;KeyPassword&quot; are the desired keystore 
and key passwords for the certificate, &quot;Creator&quot; is the name of the applet's 
creator, &quot;365&quot; forces the certificate to be valid for 365 days (use any value if desired) and &quot;mykey&quot; is 
the default keystore alias (a.k.a.: the default name of the generated 
certificate).</p>
<p>Please refer to the following guides for the applet-signing 
tools available in Sun's Java SDK:</p>
