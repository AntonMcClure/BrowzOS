<p class="c3">Welcome to BrowzOS!</p>
<p>BrowzOS is an online project whose chief goal is to address an 
encourage the creativity of aspiring web designers and applet 
programmers. Namely, the goal of BrowzOS is to give web designers and applet 
programmers a solid base for their web-related projects; a simulated operating 
system in which programmers and designers can create, display and run any web 
applet of any kind, using any programming language and any scripting language. 
Due to the fact that this project is a simulated operating system, BrowzOS 
especially encourages Java programmers (from novices to professionals) to create 
applets whose functionality extends across both the web server's and the client 
computer's file system.</p>
<p>With the ever-evolving functionality and 
popularity of the internet, this project presents a great opportunity that 
anyone can take advantage of; this project is OPEN-SOURCE AND IN THE PUBLIC 
DOMAIN. This means a number of things:</p>
<ul><li>For hobbyist web designers, BrowzOS can be 
freely downloaded, modified and used for such things as  presenting 
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, pictures, videos and music through the free/open-source 
applets included in the main package. Setting up the site is simple and is 
merely a matter of time to fully implement.</li>
<li>For novice/professional web designers and 
programmers, this project can not only be used as a testing facility for other 
open-source applet projects, but can also present the resulting creations in a 
manner that familiarly resembles the look and feel of a mainstream operating 
system (such as GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows). Since the simulated environment 
is completely user-customisable, multiple applets can be created, displayed and 
executed from within the web browser in a matter of minutes. BrowzOS can even be 
customised for use as a free/charitable online service to ease various 
education/business-related undertakings in which collaboration is a necessity.</li>
<li>For educational institutions, non-governmental 
organisations, governments of developing nations and charitable organisations, 
this project can be used as a collaboration tool, easing any undertaking in 
which project planning, research, documentation and constant communication 
between team members is a must.</li>
<li>For the average computer user, this project 
(and the included/resulting applets) can be used in hopes of providing a better 
computing environment. With such applets whose functions fully replicate word 
processors, music players and various other items that would otherwise be found 
on an ordinary desktop computer's operating system, BrowzOS will reduce (or 
hopefully, eliminate) the user's need to search for and install trial software, 
bloatware, pirated programs and programs which are potentially malicious to both 
the computer and its user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this project comes packaged with a 
word processor, scientific calculator, instant messenger, media player, clock and a tidy user interface, reminiscent of both Mac OS X 
and GNU/Linux. Hopefully, this project will inspire others to contribute, be it 
for fun or for providing a much needed public service, as intended by the 
concept of truly free and open-source software.</p>
<p class="c3">Happy computing!</p>
