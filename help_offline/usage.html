<p>Using BrowzOS is as easy as using any other mainstream operating 
system. As a matter of fact, it has never been easier to navigate the 
environment and complete different tasks. When BrowzOS starts, the web browser's 
window will transform into an eye-pleasing Desktop, 
complete with dynamic icons, an icon Dock and the ability to execute different functions.</p>
<p>On the Desktop, there are a number of icons, each representing 
an executable &quot;application.&quot; To open and run the &quot;application,&quot; click on the 
icon's name with the mouse cursor. To drag and relocate the icon to a different 
part of the Desktop, click and hold the mouse cursor on top of the icon's image 
and simply drag it to the desired position (in much the same manner as the 
desktop icons of Windows, Mac OS X and other operating systems).</p>
<p>The Dock is just as dynamic as the Desktop; when the mouse 
cursor is moved over each icon in the Dock, the icons enlarge and they're 
names appear above them (in much the same manner as the dock in 
Mac OS X). Once the mouse cursor is hovering over it, the icon's image can be clicked 
on and the &quot;application&quot; will be executed.</p>
<p>Regardless of using icons from the Dock or the Desktop to run an 
&quot;application,&quot; the &quot;application.&quot; will open in its own pop-up window. Using &quot;applications&quot; in BrowzOS is just as easy 
as using regular applications from within any mainstream operating system. Once completed with the &quot;application,&quot; simply click on the &quot;Back&quot; button of the web browser with the mouse cursor to close it and return back to the Desktop. even though the Desktop area has been occupied by an &quot;application,&quot; the Dock will remain in full view at all times (in the case a user chooses to close one &quot;application&quot; only to run another in a seamless fashion).</p>
