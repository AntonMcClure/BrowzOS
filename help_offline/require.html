<p>All software applications have hardware requirements (and 
sometimes have software requirements as well). BrowzOS is no different, except 
that the software requirements for BrowzOS are very dynamic and, at times, may 
differ depending on the way it is used. Even though this project has been 
created and tested using a computer with 512 MB of memory and a 1.6 GHz 
microprocessor, there is nothing that dictates the absolute minimum and absolute 
maximum hardware requirements for any computer.</p>
<p>These are the basic requirements for any client computer user 
who wishes to run BrowzOS from the internet:</p>
<ul><li>Any computer with internet access and any client-side operating 
system (i.e.: GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
<li>Any mainstream web browser with the ability to run web applets 
and scripts (i.e.: Internet Explorer 6 and over, Mozilla 1.7 and over, Mozilla 
Firefox, Safari, Netscape 6 and over, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: ActiveX controls and/or web browser 
plug-ins) which enable mainstream web browsers to properly run certain web 
applets and scripts (examples are Java, Flash, Shockwave, JavaScript, Visual 
BASIC script, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic requirements for any computer user 
who wishes to run BrowzOS from the hard drive:</p>
<ul><li>Any computer with internet access and any client-side operating 
system (i.e.: GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
<li>Any file archiving program or file compression program with (at 
least) ZIP file read/write access</li>
<li>Any mainstream web browser with the ability to run web applets 
and scripts (i.e.: Internet Explorer 6 and over, Mozilla 1.7 and over, Mozilla 
Firefox, Safari, Netscape 6 and over, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: ActiveX controls and/or web browser 
plug-ins) which enable mainstream web browsers to properly run certain web 
applets and scripts (examples are Java, Flash, Shockwave, JavaScript, Visual 
BASIC script, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: programming language run-time files) 
which enable mainstream operating systems to properly run certain web applets 
and scripts (such as ASP, .NET framework, PHP, SQL, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic requirements for web designers who wish to run BrowzOS 
from a server:</p>
<ul><li>Any client computer with internet access and any client-side operating 
system (i.e.: GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
<li>Any file archiving program or file compression program with (at 
least) ZIP file read/write access</li>
<li>Any SSH and/or FTP client program to access a server across the 
internet</li>
<li>Any text editor, rich text editor or &quot;what-you-see-is-what 
you-get&quot; editor (such as Frontpage, SciTe, Notepad, Vi, Microsoft Word, etc.)</li>
<li>Any server computer running server software (like Apache, IIS or 
similar)&nbsp; and any mainstream server operating system (i.e.: FreeBSD, 
Windows Server 2003, etc.)</li>
<li>Any mainstream web browser with the ability to run web applets 
and scripts (i.e.: Internet Explorer 6 and over, Mozilla 1.7 and over, Mozilla 
Firefox, Safari, Netscape 6 and over, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: ActiveX controls and/or web browser 
plug-ins) for both client computers and servers which enable mainstream web browsers to properly run certain web 
applets and scripts (examples are Java, Flash, Shockwave, JavaScript, Visual 
BASIC script, etc.)</li>
<li>Software drivers (i.e.: programming language run-time files) 
which enable both mainstream server and client operating systems to properly run 
certain web applets and scripts (like ASP, .NET framework, PHP, SQL, etc.)</li>
</ul>
