<p>Introducing BrowzOS, an open-source project to create a full-fledged, online 
operating system (well, a sort of simulated operating system); the goal of this 
project is to give BrowzOS the ability to manipulate files and folders on a client 
and/or server computer's hard drive from <strong>within a web browser</strong> instead of using the 
client's currently installed programs, as well as to encourage programmers to create 
online applets (be they in any scripting language, Flash, Shockwave, Java, etc.) 
with the ability to function as such. In spite of this, anyone is free to use 
BrowzOS for any purpose, including the creation of applets that do NOT have 
client (or server) computer file access.</p>
<p>Here's how it works; open a web browser, 
log into the BrowzOS website and the operating system's ready to go. The web page 
will lead users to a Desktop and a Dock, all in one window (similar to Mac OS X,) from 
which any user can run &quot;applications&quot; such as games, a word processor, 
a media player and other common &quot;programs&quot; found on any other operating system.</p>
<p>OK, so this sounds pretty neat, but of course this <strong>does</strong> have a few 
limitations.<br>
</p>
<ol><li>For the most part, this website works with all mainstream GRAPHICAL web 
  browsers; that is, to say, BrowzOS will NOT work in command line browsers such 
  as Links, Lynx or Arachne.<br><br><li>
  As with any other website containing applets and scripts, BrowzOS is NOT 
  lightning-fast; this is because scripts have to be interpreted by the client 
  computer's web browser.<br><br><li>
  Even though the point of the BrowzOS project is to provide an alternative to 
  software currently installed on a client computer, this does NOT mean BrowzOS 
  can ultimately replace such operating systems as Linux, Mac OS X and Windows 
  (obviously because BrowzOS is completely dependent on web browsers, which are 
  completely dependent on being installed on a hard drive and executed from a 
  mainstream operating system).</ol>
<p>For experienced programmers, BrowzOS is a great platform for creating and 
testing applets of all kinds, especially the types that directly access the client 
and/or server computer's hard 
drive. Of course, all programmers who would like to use this operating system for 
programming are free to create whatever applet they wish (such as streaming 
audio/video players, standard Flash/Shockwave/Java game applets, online 
emulators, online rich-text editors, etc.)</p>
<p>For the average computer user, BrowzOS will (hopefully) eliminate (or 
minimize) the need to download and install software from the web, especially trial 
programs, bloatware and other programs that simply fail because of improper 
installation. Since this is an open-source project intended to be a platform for 
creating &quot;alternative&quot; programs (to replace those found on a typical computer,) BrowzOS will (hopefully) reduce software piracy through the creation of TRULY 
free, open-source alternatives to such programs as word processors, spreadsheet 
programs and other expensive applications on the market.</p>
<p>For the amateur/hobbyist web designer, BrowzOS is an excellent addition to 
anyone's website; its construction is completely modular and simple to modify; 
replacing the current &quot;applications,&quot; &quot;icons&quot; and even rearranging the position of 
the Dock and Desktop has never been easier. As a matter of fact, BrowzOS can even 
be manipulated to present information in a very professional manner (such as r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, 
photos, programming projects and just about anything imaginable).</p>
