<p class="c1">BrowzOS comes packaged with PunBB 1.3.4 as forum software. Please note that PunBB has to be installed via a specialised installation procedure.</p>
<p class="c1">In order to install PunBB properly on a website, extract the zip file's contents into this folder and log into <a href="http://www.example.com/forum/admin/install.php">http://www.example.com/forum/admin/install.php</a> (where <a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com</a> is a place holder for the website's domain/subdomain name). From there, follow the proper installation procedure. Once that is done, edit the script &quot;linkdock.js&quot; (found in the &quot;browzos_source/dock&quot; directory of the download package) to omit this page (instructions for doing so can be found inside the script file).</p>
<p class="c1">PunBB is not as secure as other forum software packages unless CAPTCHA has been implemented to prevent spamming on the forum; fortunately, CAPTCHA is available through an updates repository from within the forum's administration utilities. Please note that the used CAPTCHA method is also open-source.</p>
<p class="c1">Even though PunBB has been included in this download package, this doesn't mean PunBB has to be used on a website; any forum software can be used.</p></body></html>
